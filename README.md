# 📈 Linear Regression Model

This repository contains a simple implementation of a **Linear Regression** model using Python and `scikit-learn`. The model predicts output values based on input features from a dataset, and evaluates performance using standard regression metrics.

## 📄 Project Overview

The notebook (`mlp1.ipynb`) includes:
- Loading and exploring the dataset
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Training a linear regression model using `scikit-learn`
- Visualizing predictions vs actual values
- Evaluating the model with metrics such as:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score

## 📁 Files

- `mlp1.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation, visualizations, and results.

## ⚙️ Requirements

To run this notebook, you'll need:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- The following Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
